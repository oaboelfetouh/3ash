# BACKEND
backend system of the sign-in, sign-up and change password system, creating the dataset SQLite using tortoise and python classes, accessing the dataset through tortoise layer. 
Created all the APIs using FastAPI, passing the data in and out the API through a pydantic layer to ensure that the data is of the right type.
I also created the security login system (email and password verification).
